Recently, deep learning methods have shown great potential in various tasks that involve handling large amounts of digital data. In the field of Medical imaging research, deep learning methods are also rapidly being applied in a wide range of areas to complement or replace traditional model-based methods. Deep learning methods have shown remarkable improvements in several MR image processing areas such as image reconstruction, image quality improvement, parameter mapping, image contrast conversion, and image segmentation.
In those project I applied different deep neural networks for medical image classification and image segmentation like as EfficientNet, VGG16 model, Ensemble models and Convolutional Neural Networks, assessing their performance with several metrics.
